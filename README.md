# Communications Working Group Charter
v0.1.0

Chair: Dame (dame@protocol.ai)

## Mission & Scope

The mission of the IPFS Communications Working Group is to collaborate on and oversee IPFS communication channels (email, social media, blog, website, forums, chat) and the content which is disseminated through them. The Working Group’s efforts and output are meant to play a part in fostering a healthy and growing ecosystem that supports the protocol’s overall success. 

## Objectives & Goals
- To provide greater levels of transparency, accessibility, and community around how IPFS communicates about itself to the world.
- To report on the outcomes of communication initiatives and projects on a regular basis.
- To ensure important angles, topics, and news are communicated on a timely basis.
- To foster faster growth of the ecosystem and adoption of the technology through buzz and the dissemination of noteworthy content.

## Conduct
- Meetings will be open to all who adhere to the [IPFS Community Code of Conduct](https://ipfs.fyi/coc).
- Meetings will be facilitated by the Chair.
- Meetings will occur weekly at a regular time, day, and location unless otherwise communicated.
- The IPFS Forums will be the primary channel where announcements, discussions, and meta communications about the working group will happen.
- Meetings will end with a clear understanding of expectations and assignments for next steps.
- The Chair will keep a record of meeting attendees, key discussions, and actions required. A verbatim record of the meeting will not be prepared.
- Goal setting and planning will occur on a quarterly basis.

## Decision Making
The working group is primarily advisory. In areas where it reasonably has some decision-making input, members will strive to reach agreement by consensus at a level that indicates that all partners are willing to “live with” the proposed action. If agreement cannot be reached on an issue, the Chair will retain final decision-making authority.
